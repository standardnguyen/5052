# De-Anonymize Prediction Markets

https://bsky.app/profile/standard.bsky.social/post/3lfavnew6p22q

against unregulated platforms like polymarket where bets can be placed anonymously, for the same reason why regular stock trading platforms shouldn't be run anonymously

> where there is moral hazard where someone can easily do something to make the prediction worse or make an event happen

like this is potential issue with pretty much any commodity future and stock, which is why we just... ban people from trading anonymously

yeah sticking a name to the bets makes complete sense, banning onion futures doesn't.

banning polymarket from operating wasn't a great idea, it just moved shit offseas. instead we should be empowering kalshi and giving them a more predictable regulatory environment
