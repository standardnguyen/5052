# Introduction

Some members of Congress do not take the threat to democracy seriously enough. We measure their level of concern transparently through their votes on key bills and resolutions.

# Data Points

# Migrations

In case someone ever wants to replicate the database and rebuild the data themselves, the migrations are there to help guide them along. The migrations will probably fail in small ways due to small changes in how the world works, or different versions of python. So ultimately you still need to know how to debug when things crash. Good luck!
