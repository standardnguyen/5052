# Project 5052

a repository for liberal ideas that hopefully will turn into a fully-fledged document that surpasses Project 2025 in detail and quality 

# ./Pitches

Ideas that have been found on bluesky, X, or anywhere else. Originators of the ideas have been cited.

# ./Important Things

core purposes that shape our direction. These are the foundational concepts that inform decisions, strategies, and valuesâ€”more abstract but essential to our mission.

# Meta

Documentation, Pitches, Infrastructure about the project itself. For example, things that would be encourage the development of 5052: UX that removes friction, online suggestion boxes?

# Structure 

Currently no structure has been set, aside from creating an "Inbox" folder which is named Pitches.

# How to contribute 

If you know how to use Github and are familiar with it, feel free to make pull requests or issue requests.

If not, feel free to message us on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/standard.bsky.social) or discord, username "standardsystem". We'll of course give appropriate credit on the docs.

Fundamentally, a big document is a collection of sentences. contributing even one sentence can help. If you find a good tweet/skeet that provides context, uh, direction or anything for any pitch then that could also be useful.

Project 2025 was not written by one individual person: it was a team effort, with a whole bunch of contributions probably being just a single sentence each that were then organized into a coherent paragraph. 

# Themes

Many of the pitches tackle what Samantha Hancox-Li refers to as the ["rents-scams-gentry-gop axis"](https://bsky.app/profile/sjshancoxli.liberalcurrents.com/post/3kxn5z43mh723), which is the major faction of the Republican party that contributes nothing to the economy (and often even damages it) while capturing much of the value created by others. Weakening that group is uh, is important because we don't want rent-seekers to become wealthy and wield political power.

It's worth noting that 2025 goes deep into modifying bureaucracy, so that should probably also be a thing to look at. Winning power is important, but so is wielding it effectively!
