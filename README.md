# Project 5052

a repository for liberal ideas that hopefully will turn into a fully-fledged document that surpasses Project 2025 in detail and quality 

# Pitches 

Ideas that have been found on bluesky, X, or anywhere else. Originators of the ideas have been cited.

# Structure 

Currently no structure has been set, aside from creating an "Inbox" folder which is named Pitches.

# How to contribute 

If you know how to use Github and are familiar with it, feel free to make pull requests or issue requests.

If not, feel free to message us on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/standard.bsky.social) or discord, username "standardsystem". We'll of course give appropriate credit on the docs.

# Themes

Many of the pitches tackle what Samantha Hancox-Li refers to as the ["rents-scams-gentry-gop axis"](https://bsky.app/profile/sjshancoxli.liberalcurrents.com/post/3kxn5z43mh723), which is the major faction of the Republican party that contributes nothing to the economy (and often even damages it) while capturing much of the value created by others. Weakening that group is uh, is important because we don't want rent-seekers to become wealthy and wield political power.
