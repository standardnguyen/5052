# Introduction

Some Democratic members of Congress do not take the threat to democracy seriously enough. We measure their level of concern transparently through their votes on key bills.

### From Claude 3.7:

Based on my analysis of the Laken Riley Act (Public Law 119-1), here are the key concerns that someone advocating for civil liberties and antifascism might raise:

#### Mandatory Detention Without Due Process
The law mandates detention for non-citizens who are merely charged with (not convicted of) certain offenses like theft, shoplifting, or burglary. This raises significant due process concerns as it:

1. Removes individualized assessment of whether detention is necessary
2. Imposes detention based on charges rather than convictions
3. Applies mandatory detention to minor offenses like shoplifting

#### Expanded State Power to Target Immigrants
The act gives state attorneys general unprecedented power to sue federal officials when immigrants are released:

1. Sets an extremely low threshold for "harm" ($100)
2. Creates a mechanism for states to force stricter enforcement
3. Requires expedited court processing of these cases
4. Circumvents traditional limits on injunctive relief against immigration enforcement

#### Targeting Vulnerable Populations
The law specifically targets immigrants who may be in economically vulnerable positions:

1. Focuses heavily on crimes potentially related to economic necessity (theft, shoplifting)
2. Limits humanitarian parole by creating easier challenges to release decisions
3. Creates a system where even minor alleged infractions can lead to indefinite detention

#### Undermining Federal Authority
A civil liberties advocate might argue this law deliberately creates conflict between state and federal authorities:

1. Gives states power to override federal enforcement priorities
2. Creates litigation mechanisms specifically designed to force more aggressive detention
3. Disrupts the traditional balance of immigration enforcement power

#### Surveillance and Over-policing Concerns
The mandatory detention requirements could lead to:

1. Increased surveillance of immigrant communities
2. Over-policing of minor infractions specifically for immigration enforcement
3. Creation of a two-tiered justice system where immigrants face harsher consequences than citizens for identical charges

An antifascist perspective would particularly emphasize how this law concentrates state power, expands detention without trial, targets vulnerable populations, and creates mechanisms for more aggressive enforcement against specific groups - all hallmarks of authoritarian governance.
